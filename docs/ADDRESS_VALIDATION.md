# Administering Address Validation

One of the sources of unnecessary frustration and expense is shipping items to the incorrect address. To alleviate this issue, the eBay Exchange Platform enables shoppers to validate the shipping address.

- Address validation is required in order to use eBay Enterprise fulfillment services.
- A customer may choose to complete checkout with an address that did not pass validation.
- Address validation takes place during checkout, when creating an order in the admin, and when adding an address to a registered user’s address book.

To configure address validation:

1. Log in to the Magento Admin Panel as an administrator.
1. Click System → Configuration → EBAY ENTERPRISE → Exchange Platform.
1. To change the scope of your settings, from the Current Configuration Scope list on the left, click the appropriate option. For example, to configure options for store view scope, click the name of a store view.
1. In the right pane, click the Address Validation tab to expand it.
1. Configuration options:
  1. **`Enable Address Validation`**: Select *`Yes`* for to enable the service or *`No`* to disable it.
